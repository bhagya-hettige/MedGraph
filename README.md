# MedGraph
Source code for MedGraph will be published here upon publication.

We plot 2-D visualisation of the code embeddings learned from MedGraph.
First, Medgraph produces 128-dimensional code embeddings for ICD-10-CM codes.
Then, we use t-SNE to project these embeddings into 2 dimensions, for visualisation.
Colour of a code indicates its associated CCS class.
When you hover on the plot, you can see the ICD code, its definition and the relevant CCS class.
